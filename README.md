# ASPRILO
ASPRILO, an intra-logistics benchmark suite for answer set programming https://asprilo.github.io/
see also github repository https://github.com/potassco/asprilo

This project aims to extend ASPRILO solver (using CLINGO) with MAPF family solvers, 
starting from M family problems (only moving toward shelves in the warehouse),
future work would be to confront A B C family problems by reducing it to MAPF problem,
and solving with MAPF solvers.

## Getting Started

* While ASPRILO states sometimes being able to be installed on Windows platform, 
  we have found it can be installed on Linux only (some commands exists only on Linux platform).
* Read carefully asprilo site and install the generator and vizualizer.
* Install dotnet core, in order to be able to run the MAPF solvers DLLs.
*
